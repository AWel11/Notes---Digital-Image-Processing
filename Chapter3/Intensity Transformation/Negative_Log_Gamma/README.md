## I'm kind confused because of the different window size with Qt-ON and OFF.

OpenCV with Qt backend

* if you create the window by default, it will have a bar with tools, and usually show a bigger window (seems the image getting bigger too)
* when create the window with "cv::WINDOW_GUI_NORMAL", the window is a "normal" one, and is smaller than the default one.  
  **I don't know why, it makes me harder to show different window at the same time  
  in which can make it look contrasting.**
